/**
 * State works like a snapshot, so you canâ€™t read the latest state from an asynchronous operation like a timeout. However, you can keep the latest input text in a ref. A ref is mutable, so you can read the current property at any time. Since the current text is also used for rendering, in this example, you will need both a state variable (for rendering), and a ref (to read it in the timeout). You will need to update the current ref value manually.
