/**
 * Calling ref.current.focus() during render is wrong because it is a side 
 * effect. Side effects should either be placed inside an event handler or be 
 * declared with useEffect. In this case, the side effect is caused by the 
 * component appearing rather than by any specific interaction, so it makes 
 * sense to put it in an Effect.
 * To fix the mistake, wrap the ref.current.focus() call into an Effect 
 * declaration. Then, to ensure that this Effect runs only on mount rather 
 * than after every render, add the empty [] dependencies to it.
 * 
 * Put the conditional logic inside the Effect. You will need to specify 
 * shouldFocus as a dependency because you are using it inside the Effect. 
 * (This means that if some inputâ€™s shouldFocus changes from false to true, 
 * it will focus after mount.)
